Creational Patterns

  Abstract Factory	Creates an instance of several families of classes
  Builder	Separates object construction from its representation
  Factory Method	Creates an instance of several derived classes
  Prototype	A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
  Singleton	A class of which only a single instance can exist 


Creates an instance of several derived classes. 
Frameworks use abstract classes to define and maintain relationships between objects. 
A framework is often responsible for creating these objects as well.
This creates a dilemma: The framework must instantiate classes, but it only knows about abstract classes, which it cannot instantiate.
The Factory Method pattern offers a solution. It encapsulates the knowledge of which subclass to create and moves this knowledge out of the framework.
